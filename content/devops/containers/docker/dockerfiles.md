# Dockerfiles

A Dockerfile is a text file with instructions for building a Docker image. Not every instruction creates a
filesystem layer — only `RUN`, `COPY`, and `ADD` do. Instructions like `ENV`, `EXPOSE`, and `CMD` add metadata
only. Docker caches layers to speed up rebuilds.

## Key Instructions

- `FROM` — base image to build on (e.g., `node:20-alpine`)
- `WORKDIR` — sets the working directory inside the container
- `COPY` / `ADD` — copy files from host into the image
- `RUN` — execute a command during build (e.g., `npm install`)
- `EXPOSE` — specifies on which port the app is listening. Does **not** actually open the port — you still need `-p`
at runtime to publish it.
- `CMD` — default command (or default arguments to `ENTRYPOINT`) when the container starts
- `ENTRYPOINT` — the executable the container always runs

## CMD vs ENTRYPOINT

`ENTRYPOINT` defines the program. `CMD` provides default arguments. When someone overrides the command at runtime with
`docker run myapp worker.js`, they replace `CMD`, not `ENTRYPOINT`.

If your entrypoint is `node` and your command is `server.js`, then `docker run myapp worker.js` runs `node worker.js`.
The entrypoint stays, the arguments change. Use `ENTRYPOINT` when the container should always run the same program. 
Use `CMD` for the default arguments someone might want to swap.

## Layer Caching

Docker caches each layer. If a layer's instruction and inputs haven't changed, Docker reuses the cached version.
Order matters — put instructions that change less frequently (like installing dependencies) before those that
often change (like copying source code), this is make your builds faster.

## Multi-Stage Builds

Multi-stage builds use multiple `FROM` instructions to separate build-time dependencies from the final runtime image.
This keeps production images small and free of build tools.

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

## Build Context

When you run `docker build .`, the dot is the **build context** — the set of files available to `COPY` instructions.
If your project has large directories you don't need in the image, a broad `COPY . .` pulls them all in.
Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files and keep builds fast.

## Best Practices

- Use specific base image tags, not `latest`
- Combine `RUN` commands to reduce layers
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files from the build context
- Prefer `COPY` over `ADD` — `COPY` only copies local files, which makes it predictable. `ADD` can also fetch
  URLs and auto-extract tar archives, which introduces unexpected behavior if you just need to copy files.
